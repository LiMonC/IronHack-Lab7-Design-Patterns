# IronHack-Lab7-Design-Patterns

## 1 Design Problem Solving:

* **Scenario Description**: Participants are provided with a series of common software design challenges. They will need to choose appropriate design patterns to solve these specific problems effectively.

* Design Challenges:

  * **Global Configuration Management**: Design a system that ensures a single, globally accessible configuration object without access conflicts.

  * **Dynamic Object Creation Based on User Input**: Implement a system to dynamically create various types of user interface elements based on user actions.

  * **State Change Notification Across System Components**: Ensure components are notified about changes in the state of other parts without creating tight coupling.

  * **Efficient Management of Asynchronous Operations**: Manage multiple asynchronous operations like API calls which need to be coordinated without blocking the main application workflow.

* **Task**: Outline solutions that integrate these patterns into a cohesive design to address the challenges.
